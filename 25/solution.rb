# Solution to Project Euler problem 25
# By Trey Thomas
#
# | The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:
# |
# | Fn = Fnâˆ’1 + Fnâˆ’2, where F1 = 1 and F2 = 1.
# |
# | Hence the first 12 terms will be:
# |
# | F1 = 1
# | F2 = 1
# | F3 = 2
# | F4 = 3
# | F5 = 5
# | F6 = 8
# | F7 = 13
# | F8 = 21
# | F9 = 34
# | F10 = 55
# | F11 = 89
# | F12 = 144
# |
# | The 12th term, F12, is the first term to contain three digits.
# |
# | What is the first term in the Fibonacci sequence to contain 1000 digits?
#
# Reusing class from problem 2, modified to track the term number.
