# Solution to Project Euler problem 32
# By Trey Thomas
#
# | We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the
# | digits 1 to n exactly once; for example, the 5-digit number, 15234, is 1
# | through 5 pandigital.
# |
# | The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity, 39 Ã— 186 = 7254, containing
# | multiplicand, multiplier, and product is 1 through 9 pandigital.
# |
# | Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity
# | can be written as a 1 through 9 pandigital.
# |
# | HINT: Some products can be obtained in more than one way so be sure to only
# | include it once in your sum.
